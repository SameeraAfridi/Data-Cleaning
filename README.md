Data Cleaning & Quality Report
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning workflow using a messy dataset. The goal is to detect and handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers, then generate a Data Quality Report to ensure dataset reliability.

Dataset used: Dirtydataset.csv (sample customer data with intentional errors).

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🎯 Relevance

Data quality is critical in research and analytics. This project focus on data integrity, showing how systematic cleaning ensures datasets are accurate and reliable for further analysis or modeling.

⚙️ Steps Performed

Load Dataset – Import CSV and explore structure.

Detect Issues – Identify missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Clean Data –

Drop duplicate rows

Fill missing values (mean for numeric, mode for categorical)

Handle outliers using visual inspection

Generate Report – Create summary statistics (mean, median, std, min/max, distributions).

Save Outputs – Export cleaned dataset and Data Quality Report as CSVs.

📈 Results

Clean dataset with no missing values or duplicates.
